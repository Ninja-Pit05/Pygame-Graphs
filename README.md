# Pygame-Graphs
A project to designed to draw graphs on pygame in an easy and fast way. A hobby project made for fun.

### How to use it
So far you'll need to download PygameGraph.py and install it manually. I'll add a way to `pip install` it later.

To import it, use:
```python
import PygameGraphs
```
Or select a specific graph type to work with using:
```python
from PygameGraphs import "Graph Name"
```

So far, the graphs available are:
- Bargraph
