# Pygame-Graphs
A project to draw graphs on pygame. A hobby project made for fun.

This project is intended to facilitate the procces of rendering data in an easy and objective way using pygame. Even tho it's very unlikely someone is actually going to use that Library, I'm doing it for fun.

--Read me is still a work in progress.
